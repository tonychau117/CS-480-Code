File Contributors:
- Tony: best_fit.C, main.C, stats.C, memory.h
- Enrique: first_fit.C, request.C, main.C, Makefile 

Compile Instructions:
- GCC since it is written in C

Operating Instructions:
- In the terminal, use the following commands in this order to run the C file:
    - make ff
    - ./sim
    - make bf
    - ./sim
- After testing exit in the terminal with
    - make clean
    - exit

List/description of novel/significant design decisions:
- N/A

List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality you included which were not
required:
- The inclusion of a linked list structure

List/description of all known deficiencies or bugs:
- Only one “fit” can be ran at a time

Lessons Learned:
- Some of the lessons learned through this assignment as are follows:
    - Learning how a memory allocation and deallocation works
    - Understanding the difference between first_fit and best_fit
    - Fragment checking
